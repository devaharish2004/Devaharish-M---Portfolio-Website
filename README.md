# Devaharish-M - Portfolio-Website

This is my first ever portfolio website which I have created using React. Feel free to check it out !

The gitkeep files are just empty files used to create a directory in Github.

Do not forget to import all the node modules inside the client folder.

PS : Use links to navigate inside the page instead of scrolling for better user experience.
